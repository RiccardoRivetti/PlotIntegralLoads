# PlotIntegralLoads
MATLAB scripts to integral loads computed via DUST

This repository is comprised of two scripts:
  - main.m --> Used to plot CD-alpha, CL-alpha, efficiency and polar diagram of both the wing and the whole plane
  - checkConvergence.m --> Used to plot the change of CD and CL against simulation time/timesteps.
                           (Intended for checking if the simulation is converging)
